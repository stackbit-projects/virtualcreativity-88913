excerpt: A study estimated that 2% of the U.S. population is unable to play a game
  at all because of an impairment and 9% can play games but suffers from a reduced
  gaming experience. A study conducted by casual games studio PopCap games found that
  an estimated one in five casual video gamers have a physical, mental or developmental

Wikipedia states video game accessibility as a subfield of computer accessibility, which studies how software and computers can be made accessible to users with various types of impairments. A study estimated that 2% of the U.S. population is unable to play a game at all because of an impairment and 9% can play games but suffers from a reduced gaming experience. A study conducted by casual games studio _PopCap games_ found that an estimated one in five casual video gamers have a physical, mental or developmental disability. Many more have situational impairments or difficulties such as playing in a noisy room or in bright sunlight, or just find the game difficult.

The main accessibility challenges are:

* Sensory impairment: This includes hearing and visual impairment. Hence the player is not able to receive feedback from the game.
* Motor impairment: Due to impaired or restricted movement of hands, the player finds it difficult or impossible to play games.
* Cognitive impairment: The player may not be able to understand how to play the game or what input to provide due to learning disabilities.

| Name | Effect on Games |
| Deaf or Hard of Hearing | • Prevents gamer from following cut scenes or dialogs that may contain plot information.• Could prevent gamer from receiving game cues such as footsteps, explosions or other sounds. |
| Visual – Blindness, Low Vision, or Color Blindness | • Color schemes may make it difficult for the color blind to see the game and differentiate between color coded information .• Small objects on the screen may not be visible to those with low vision.• Visually based games will not be accessible to the blind. |
| Mobility | • Games that do not support alternative input devices may be inaccessible.• Games that do allow rebinding of controls may be inaccessible.• A lack of configurable difficulty levels could prevent gamers from completely enjoying the game. |
| Cognitive | • Lack of a tutorial mode could be a problem for dyslexics.• Games that require a lot of micromanagement like RTS games will be difficult for those with learning impairments |

## What can be done?

| --- | --- |
| Challenge | Strategy |
| Sensory impairment | • Enhance stimuli: for example, high contrast color scheme, increased font size, color blind friendly color scheme and zoom options• Replace stimuli: for example, subtitles or closed captioning, audio cues, sonification, speech synthesis or haptic cues. |
| Motor impairment | • Replace input: for example, support for direct voice input or a brain-computer interface.• Reduce input: for example, switch access scanning and remove or automate inputs. |
| Cognitive impairment | • Reduce stimuli: for example, limit the number of game objects, or simply the storyline.• Reduce time constraints: for example, slow down the game.• Reduce input: for example, remove or automate inputs that needs to be provided. |

We will discuss about these issues detail individually in further posts.
